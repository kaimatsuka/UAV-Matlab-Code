%% Engine sizing calculation

% calc_engn

engn.W_bare = 3.5; % bare engine weight
engn.N_E = 1;      % number of engines
engn.HP = 5.2;     %engine horse power (selected from engine)

%% Propeller sizing calcuation

calc_propeller
P_avail = engn.HP*prop.eta_p; % Power available

%% Fuel Calculation

fuel.cp = 0.85/550/3600;  %[1/ft] specific fuel consumption
fuel.rho = 6.073; %[lbm/gallon] density of fuel for octane gas
fuel.W = 3.5;             %[lb] fuel weight (calculated using test_fuel.m file)
fuel.V = fuel.W/fuel.rho; %[gallon] volume of fuel
fuel.V = fuel.V*gallon2ft3; %[ft^3] volume of fuel

%% Fuel Calculation

fsys.int = 0.00; %percent of fuel tanks that are integral TODO: find out how much is integral
fsys.N_T = 1;    %number of separate fuel tanks

%% Payload 

payld.w_EOIR  = 12.57; % EO/IR weight(lbs)
payld.w_SAR   = 2;     % Synthetic Apperature Radar weight(lbs)
payld.w_LiDAR = 1;     % LiDAR weight(lbs)
payld.w_ANT   = 0.15;  % UHF/VHF antenna weight (lbs)
payld.w_WR    = 0.25;  % WaveRelay weight (lbs)
payld.w_IMU   = 0.11;  % Ellipse E mini (lbs)

% Pyaload/Avionics total weight
payld.w_total = payld.w_EOIR + payld.w_SAR + payld.w_LiDAR + payld.w_ANT ...
                + payld.w_WR + payld.w_IMU;

%% Surface Control Weights
% These are servos or mechanisms that move control surfaces like ailron

% TODO: update the equation with actual servos
WEIGHT.sc  = 0.4915*W_TO^(2/3); % Nadia Equation %TODO: update with actual servos
ail.w_sfcl  = WEIGHT.sc*0.75;   % approximation
rudd.w_sfcl = WEIGHT.sc*0.125;
elev.w_sfcl = WEIGHT.sc*0.125;

% WEIGHT.sc    = W_SC(W_TO); %surface controls (powered)
% WEIGHT.esys  = W_ES(WEIGHT.fsys,WEIGHT.avion); %electrical system

% Sum of components
