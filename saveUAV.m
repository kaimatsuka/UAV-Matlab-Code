% DESCRIPTION:
%   This funciton saves UAV parameters into UAV structure.
%
% INPUT:
%   wing = wing structure of current case
%   airfoilw = airfoil structure
%   fuse = fuselage structure
%   htail = horizontal tail structure
%   airfoilh = horizontal tail airfoil structure
%   vtail = vertical tail structure
%   airfoilv = vertical tail airfoil structure
%   engn = engine strucutre
%   fsys = fuel system structure
%   prop = propeller structure
%   payld = payload structure
%   stab = stability structure
%   loadfact    = load factor structure
%   WEIGHT = weight of aircraft
%
% REVISION HISTORY:
%   02/28: File created.
