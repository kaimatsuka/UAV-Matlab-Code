function y = K(mtl,mtr,M,swp_max)
% 
% DESCRIPTION:
%   This calculates form factor for subsonic drag estimation for wing,
%   tail,strut, and pylon.
%
% INPUT:
%   mtl     = chordwise location of airfoil max thickness location
%   mtr     = maximum thickness ratio
%   M       = mach number 
%   swp_max = sweep angle of max thickness line
